Routinator 3000 is free, open source :abbr:`RPKI (Resource Public Key
Infrastructure)` Relying Party software written by `NLnet Labs
<https://nlnetlabs.nl>`_ in the Rust programming language. Routinator is a full
featured software package that runs as a service which periodically downloads
and verifies RPKI data. The built-in HTTP server offers a user interface and API
endpoints for various file formats, as well as logging, status and Prometheus
metrics.

Routinator has a built-in an RTR server allowing routers supporting route origin
validation (ROV) to connect to it to fetch verified RPKI data. Note that if you
would like to run the RTR server as a separate daemon, for example because you
want to centralise validation and distribute processed data to various locations
where routers can connect, then NLnet Labs provides :doc:`RTRTR <rtrtr:index>`.

If you run into a problem with Routinator or you have a feature request, please
`create an issue on Github <https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/issues>`_.
For community support and exchanging operational experiences we provide a
`mailing list <https://lists.nlnetlabs.nl/mailman/listinfo/rpki>`_ and a
`Discord server <https://discord.gg/8dvKB5Ykhy>`_. There are also `professional
support services <https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/services/contracts/>`_ with a
service-level agreement available.
